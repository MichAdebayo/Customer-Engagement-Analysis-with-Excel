# Customer-Engagement-Analysis-with-Excel

The project aims at analyzing some customer engagement metrics for 365 Company to determine whether the addition of new features increased student engagement.

## Case Description

In 2022, there were high expectations for the growth of the 365 company and increased student engagement based on the introduction of new website platform features. Some of these features included an XP system that enabled students to track their progress, level up, and earn rewards by completing various learning objectives. The platform also offered in-app coins that could be exchanged for special awards, a leaderboard where students could compete for top positions in different divisions, earning weekly rewards and advancing up the ladder, and streaks to motivate students to maintain consistent learning habits. Additionally, the company expanded its course library, covering a broader range of topics to provide its students with a richer set of skills and attract a larger audience. These enhancements were anticipated to positively impact the student experience, create an effective strategy for customer engagement, and contribute to the company's success in the coming year. With this Customer Engagement Analysis Excel project, I analyze whether the new additions to the platform have increased student engagement.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project comes from the 365 company, hence, it is a real-world dataset that represent the company’s operations. Note that personal user information has been masked to ensure privacy. The following are the column values available in the data: 

* **student_id –** the unique identifier for each student in the dataset. The field contains IDs for students who used the 365 Data Science platform with free or paid accounts in **Q4 2021** (October 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021, both included) and **Q4 2022** (October 1, 2022 – December 31, 2022, both included).

* **student_country –** identifies the country of each student. The field provides information about students’ geographic location and can help analyze regional differences or conduct country-specific analyses.

* **minutes_watched_21 –** represents the student’s engagement level, as expressed by the number of minutes a student has watched in Q4 2021.
  
* **minutes_watched_22 –** denotes the student’s engagement level, as expressed by the number of minutes a student has watched in Q4 2022.

* **Paid –** indicates whether a student had a paid account during the specified period. It is a binary variable, where '1' represents a paid account and '0' represents a free or unpaid account. It helps differentiate between students who have access to additional features or content through a paid subscription.

## Tasks

#### **Task 1:** Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for paid-plan and free-plan student groups. Is there a difference in engagement between paid- and free-plan subscribers?
